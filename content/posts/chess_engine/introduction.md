# Introduction
Let's start things off with a why?. Out of everything why even start building a chess engine?. Well, for starters chess is cool, and for second the idea of me building something that could beat me is pretty cool. 

## Learning Outcomes:
Well, I wanna build a bot rated atlest 2000 elo, that supports:
- UCI
- NNUE
- FEN
- BitBoards
- Magic BitBoards
- Minimax 
    - Nega Max
- MVV-LVA ordering
- ... And anything else that I find down the line.
